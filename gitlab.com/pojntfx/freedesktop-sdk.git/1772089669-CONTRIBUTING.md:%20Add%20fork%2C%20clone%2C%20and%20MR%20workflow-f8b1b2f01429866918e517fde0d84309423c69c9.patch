 ## Create a GitLab account
 Simply click "sign in/register" in the top right corner and fill in the form.
 
-## Clone our GitLab repo
-Open a terminal and type:
+## Fork and clone the repo
+Go to the [fork page](https://gitlab.com/freedesktop-sdk/freedesktop-sdk/-/forks/new) on GitLab to create your own copy of our repo under your account.
+
+Once you have forked the repo, open a terminal and clone your fork (replace MY_USERNAME with your GitLab username):
 ```
-git clone https://gitlab.com/freedesktop-sdk/freedesktop-sdk.git
+git clone https://gitlab.com/MY_USERNAME/freedesktop-sdk.git
 ```
 If you have an SSH key associated with your GitLab account you can alternatively type
 ```
-git clone git@gitlab.com:freedesktop-sdk/freedesktop-sdk.git
+git clone git@gitlab.com:MY_USERNAME/freedesktop-sdk.git
 ```
 to avoid having to type your password when pushing.
 
+It is also useful to add the upstream repository as a remote so you can keep your fork up to date:
+```
+git remote add upstream https://gitlab.com/freedesktop-sdk/freedesktop-sdk.git
+```
+
 Please make sure that your git is connected with your email and name using
 ```
 git config user.name "MY_NAME"
 git config user.email "MY_EMAIL@example.com"
 ```
 
-There are also many GUI git interfaces, such as integration with IDEs and GitHub's UI, however running through all of these alternative methods would be a mammoth task. Feel free to add instructions for your personal preferred git workflow.

+Run the following commands to push your branch to your fork:
 
 ```
 git push --set-upstream origin my-branch-name

-Your branch will now begin going through our CI runners, which build the SDK on multiple architectures to ensure that your changes have not caused a break anywhere. Additionally it will check for ABI changes.

-Crypto components may break forward ABI (not backward ABI) compatibility for security updates on a stable branch
 
 It is also good practice to rebase your changes before pushing (so that your commits are on top of the target branch), to do this run
 ```
-git rebase origin/master
+git fetch upstream
+git rebase upstream/master
 ```
 while your branch is checked out. This may require you to force-push your branch, to do this add the `-f` switch to the git push command.
 
 ## Open a merge request
-Navigate to the [New Merge Request Page](https://gitlab.com/freedesktop-sdk/freedesktop-sdk/merge_requests/new) on our GitLab, add your branch as the source branch and master as the target branch.
+Navigate to your fork's New Merge Request page at https://gitlab.com/MY_USERNAME/freedesktop-sdk/-/merge_requests/new (replace MY_USERNAME with your GitLab username). There, select your fork and branch as the source, and master as the target branch.
 Once your MR is open it will be reviewed before merging. Once it passes our CI and any discussions are resolved, it will be assigned to our merge bot, which will continually rebase onto the latest commit in master until it merges your branch.
 
 Congratulations, you are now a freedesktop-sdk contributor!
