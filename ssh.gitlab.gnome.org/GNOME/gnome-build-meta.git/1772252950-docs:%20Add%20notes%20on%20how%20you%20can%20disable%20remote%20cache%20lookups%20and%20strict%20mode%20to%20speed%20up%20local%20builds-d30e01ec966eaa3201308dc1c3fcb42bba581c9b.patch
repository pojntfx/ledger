 Now make the changes you want to make in your workspace, for example in `../linux` or `../gnome-control-center`. BuildStream will pick up your changes from this workspace automatically after you make them.
 
+The first build might take a while depending on your workstation's specs. You can significantly speed up subsequent builds by running the following:
+
+```shell
+$ cat > ~/.config/buildstream.conf << 'EOT'
+artifacts:
+  override-project-caches: true
+source-caches:
+  override-project-caches: true
+projects:
+  gnome-build-meta:
+    strict: false
+EOT
+```
+
+Here, `strict: false` avoids rebuilding the whole chain on the next build, and `override-project-caches: true` disables remote cache lookups which, while helpful on the first build, can significantly slow down things on subsequent builds.

 To build a component, first open a workspace for it as described in [Making changes](#making-changes), then run the following to build a system extension for it:
 
 ```shell
-$ bst build core/gnome-control-center.bst # Use `bst --no-strict` to avoid rebuilding the whole chain on the next run
+$ bst build core/gnome-control-center.bst
 $ sysext-build-element --verbose zz-gnome-control-center core/gnome-control-center.bst

-> System extensions are applied alphabetically, so you want to prefix them (as we did above with `zz-`) in order to avoid being overwritten by other images that will be loaded.
+The system extension should now be available at `./zz-gnome-control-center.sysext.raw`.
