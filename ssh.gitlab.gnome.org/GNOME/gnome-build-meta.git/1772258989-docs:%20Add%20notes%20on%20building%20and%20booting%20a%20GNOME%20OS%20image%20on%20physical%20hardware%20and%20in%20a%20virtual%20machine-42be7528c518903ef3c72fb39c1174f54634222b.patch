+## 3. Building and booting a GNOME OS image
+
+<!-- TODO: Add note that if you're already running GNOME OS/have installed it from a prebuilt image (link to installation docs) and would like to deploy changes to your local workstation, skip this step and the next one and jump to "Making changes" section instead -->
+
+The first build might take a while depending on your workstation's specs and which secure boot key configuration you've set up earlier.
+
+### 3.1 Option 1: In a virtual machine
+
+To build and start a virtual machine with secure boot and a TPM, run the following; secure boot keys are generated automatically if they'd don't already exist:
+
+```shell
+$ ./utils/run-secure-vm.sh --debug-systemd --local-updates # Append `--rebuild-iso --reset-installed --reset-secure-state` to rebuild the image and completely reset the VM
+```
+
+The virtual machine image and state can be found at `./current-secure-vm/`.
+
+### 3.2 Option 2: On physical hardware
+
+First, generate the secure boot keys as described in [setting up secure boot keys](#setting-up-secure-boot-keys). Then build the ISO by running the following:
+
+```shell
+$ bst build gnomeos/live-image.bst
+$ bst artifact checkout gnomeos/live-image.bst --directory ./iso
+```
+
+The ISO can be found at `./iso/disk.iso`.
+
+You can now write the ISO to a USB stick and boot from it on physical hardware, or manually boot from it in a virtual machine.
+
+
 First, create a workspace for the GNOME OS components you want to work on; for example for the Linux kernel:
 
 ```shell
